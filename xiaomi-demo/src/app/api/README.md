# Server API Directory

This directory is reserved for future server-side API implementations.

## Current Status
- Next.js API routes are located in `/app/api/` (following Next.js conventions)
- Future server-side business logic, middleware, and advanced API handlers can be implemented here
- For simple API routes, continue using `/app/api/` as per Next.js standards

## When to Use This Directory
- Complex business logic that needs separation from Next.js routes
- Middleware and authentication handlers
- Database models and services
- API utilities and helpers that don't belong in client-side code
